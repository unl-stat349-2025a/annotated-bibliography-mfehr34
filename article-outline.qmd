Missing gaps: This article includes all of the main sections that a literature review should have (intro, body, conclusion, takeaways, future research). Additionally, the authors go into good detai for each section. Although there are no major gaps that are missing, I was surprised that the Data Science 
process wasn't mentioned at all. It depends on who you ask, but the Data Science process generally includes: defining the problem, data collection/cleaning, EDA, model building, model evaluation, and model deployment. I would argue that this is a very solidified part of Data Science, and its curriculum, these days. It would've been worthwhile to give it a mention, especially when evaluating Data Science theory at the end of the article.
