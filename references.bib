  abstract = {Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact---that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable---is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it's critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.},

This article starts with meta-questions about data science as a discipline and then elaborates on ten ideas for the basis of a research agenda for data science.},
